# First-App
Basic android app written in Java to track monthly budget and expenses. The Budget class is designed to provide methods that will be used by the DemoBudget class. This project allows users to input known monthly expense data at the start of the month, and then update it as they add expenses throughout to keep track of where they are with spending.
